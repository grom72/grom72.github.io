  content: 'This open source project is dedicated to making
    _persistent memory programming_ easier for application developers.
    Most of the activity is focused on the [Persistent Memory Development Kit](/pmdk),
    which builds on the programming model for persistent memory recommended by the
    [SNIA NVM Programming Technical Workgroup](https://snia.org/nvmp).



    What is _persistent memory_? See the full definition used by this
    project on the [Glossary page](/glossary/). In short, it is a
    tier between memory and
    storage, with attributes of both: it is byte-addressable like memory,
    and persistent like storage.
