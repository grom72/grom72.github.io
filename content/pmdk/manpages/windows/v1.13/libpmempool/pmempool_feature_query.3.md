# NAME #

**pmempool_feature_queryU**()/**pmempool_feature_queryW**(), **pmempool_feature_enableU**()/**pmempool_feature_enableW**(),
**pmempool_feature_disableU**()/**pmempool_feature_disableW**() - toggle or query pool set features

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmempool.h>

int pmempool_feature_queryU(const char *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);
int pmempool_feature_queryW(const wchar_t *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);

int pmempool_feature_enableU(const char *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);
int pmempool_feature_enableW(const wchar_t *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);

int pmempool_feature_disableU(const char *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);
int pmempool_feature_disableW(const wchar_t *path, enum pmempool_feature feature, unsigned flags);
```


>NOTE: The PMDK API supports UNICODE. If the **PMDK_UTF8_API** macro is
defined, basic API functions are expanded to the UTF-8 API with postfix *U*.
Otherwise they are expanded to the UNICODE API with postfix *W*.

# DESCRIPTION #

The *feature* argument accepts following values:

+ **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SINGLEHDR** - only the first part in each replica contains the
pool part internal metadata. This value can be used only with
**pmempool_feature_query**(). It can not be enabled or disabled. For details see
**poolset**(5).

+ **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K** - only the first 2KiB of pool part internal metadata
is checksummed. Other features may depend on this one to store additional metadata
in otherwise unused second 2KiB part of a header.
When **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K** is disabled whole 4KiB is checksummed.

+ **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE** - enables additional check performed during
pool open which verifies pool consistency in the presence of dirty shutdown.
**PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CKSUM_2K** has to be enabled prior to
**PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE** otherwise enabling **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_SHUTDOWN_STATE** will fail.

+ **PMEMPOOL_FEAT_CHECK_BAD_BLOCKS** - enables checking bad blocks performed
during opening a pool and fixing bad blocks performed by pmempool-sync
during syncing a pool. For details see **pmempool-feature**(1).

The **pmempool_feature_queryU**()/**pmempool_feature_queryW**() function checks state of *feature* in the
pool set pointed by *path*.

The **pmempool_feature_enableU**()/**pmempool_feature_enableW**() function enables *feature* in the pool set
pointed by *path*.

The **pmempool_feature_disableU**()/**pmempool_feature_disableW**() function disables *feature* in the pool set
pointed by *path*.

# COMPATIBILITY #

Poolsets with features not defined in this document (e.g. enabled by the newer
software version) are not supported.

# DISCLAIMER #

**pmempool_feature_queryU**()/**pmempool_feature_queryW**(), **pmempool_feature_enableU**()/**pmempool_feature_enableW**() and
**pmempool_feature_disableU**()/**pmempool_feature_disableW**() are not fail safe.

# RETURN VALUE #

On success, **pmempool_feature_queryU**()/**pmempool_feature_queryW**() returns 0 if *feature* is disabled or
1 if it is enabled. On error, it returns -1 and sets *errno* accordingly.

On success, **pmempool_feature_enableU**()/**pmempool_feature_enableW**() returns 0. On error, it returns -1
and sets *errno* accordingly.

On success, **pmempool_feature_disableU**()/**pmempool_feature_disableW**() returns 0. On error, it returns -1
and sets *errno* accordingly.

If non zero *flags* are provided **errno** is set to EINVAL and function
returns -1.
