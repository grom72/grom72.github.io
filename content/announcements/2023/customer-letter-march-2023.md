## Dear Customer

After careful consideration, in July 2022, Intel announced the end of future
development of our Optane products.

We are committed to supporting Optane customers and ecosystem collaborators
through the transition of our existing memory and storage product lines through their
normal end-of-life. Specifically, Intel will continue to support and warranty available
products, including Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory 200 Series and Intel®
Optane™ SSD DC P1600X, P4800X, and P5800X Series products as noted on the Intel.com website
([Link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005886/services/warranty.html)).

We currently estimate that we have media inventory on hand to sustain shipping
Optane persistent memory and Optane SSD products to meet customer demand
through 2025, subject to demand from customers. Each product includes a 5-year
warranty and post-sales support starting with the date of sale with resources in
place through 2030.

Intel continues to work with server and storage OEM suppliers as well as our
ecosystem collaborators to ensure a smooth support process. Please work with
your server and storage OEM for your Optane needs.

We are committed to partner with you on next steps for continued success with
Optane to solve today’s business challenges and to lay the foundation for CXL on
Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family as we believe it will be the standard of future
tiered-memory solutions.

Very sincerely, <br />
David Tuhy

Vice President & General Manager,
Intel Optane Group
