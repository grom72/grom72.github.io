The [PMDK repository](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/) on GitHub has become the ultimate source of information on PMDK from release 2.0. For all questions and to submit eventual issues please follow [that repository](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/issues).

The materials collected on pmem.io should be valid up to the PMDK 1.13.1 release and remains great source of information on PMDK and PMem in general but is maintained only on a best-effort basis and may not reflect the latest state of the art.
